## Requirements
- PHP 7.1.3+


## Download precompiled build
Precompiled build is created for non-developers. In this version, the frontend (html, css and javascript) is compiled for you and the source code is removed so the final archive contains only minimum files.

- Download: [v7.1.1](https://github.com/filegator/static/raw/master/builds/filegator_v7.1.1.zip)
- Unzip files and upload them to your PHP server
- Make sure you webserver can read and write to `/storage` and `/private` folders
- Set the website document root to `/dist` directory. This is also known as 'public' folder.
- Visit web page, if something goes wrong check `/private/logs/app.log`
- Login with default credentials `admin/admin123`
- Change default admin's password

NOTE: For security reasons `/dist` is the ONLY folder you want to be exposed through the web. Everything else should be outside of your web root, this way people canâ€™t access any of your important files through the browser.

## Upgrade

Since version 7 is completely rewriten from scratch, there is no clear upgrade path from the older versions.

If you have an older version of FileGator please backup everything and install the script again.
