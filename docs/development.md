npm run serve
```

## Run tests & static analysis

Testing requires xdebug, php-zip and sqlite php extensions.

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse ./backend
npm run lint
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment

Set the website document root to `filegator/dist` directory. This is also known as 'public' folder.

NOTE: For security reasons `filegator/dist` is the ONLY folder you want to be exposed through the web. Everything else should be outside of your web root, this way people canâ€™t access any of your important files through the browser. If you run the script from the root folder, you will see the message **'Development mode'** as a security warning.
