## Docker
You can use the [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/filegator/filegator) based on [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/filegator/filegator/blob/master/Dockerfile)
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d filegator/filegator
visit: http://127.0.0.1:8080 login as admin/admin123
```

## Minimum Requirements
- PHP 8.1+ (with php-zip extension)
- Node 12 - 22

## Download precompiled build
Precompiled build is created for non-developers. In this version, the frontend (html, css and javascript) is compiled for you and the source code is removed so the final archive contains only minimum files.

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/filegator/static/raw/master/builds/filegator_latest.zip)
- Unzip files and upload them to your PHP server
- Make sure your webserver can read and write to `filegator/repository/` and `filegator/private/` folders
- Set the website document root to `filegator/dist/` directory. This is also known as 'public' folder
- Visit web page, if something goes wrong check `filegator/private/logs/app.log`
- Login with default credentials `admin/admin123`
- Change default admin's password

NOTE: For security reasons `filegator/dist` is the ONLY folder you want to be exposed through the web. Everything else should be outside of your web root, this way people canâ€™t access any of your important files through the browser. If you run the script from the root folder, you will see the message **'Development mode'** as a security warning.

## Install on fresh Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10.3
On a new server ([get $100 in server credits](https://m.do.co/c/93994ebda78d)) login as root and enter this into the shell:
```
apt update
apt install -y wget unzip php apache2 libapache2-mod-php php-zip php-mbstring php-dom php-xml

cd /var/www/
wget https://github.com/filegator/static/raw/master/builds/filegator_latest.zip
unzip filegator_latest.zip && rm filegator_latest.zip

chown -R www-data:www-data filegator/
chmod -R 775 filegator/

echo "
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /var/www/filegator/dist
</VirtualHost>
" >> /etc/apache2/sites-available/filegator.conf

a2dissite 000-default.conf
a2ensite filegator.conf
systemctl restart apache2

exit
```
Open your browser and go to http://your_server_ip_address
