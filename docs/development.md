## Project setup for development (Linux)

You must have `git`, `php`, `npm`, and `composer` installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/filegator/filegator.git
cd filegator
cp configuration_sample.php configuration.php
chmod -R 775 private/
chmod -R 775 repository/
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
npm install
npm run build
```

## Project setup for development (Docker compose version)

You must have `git`, `docker` and `docker-compose-plugin` installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/filegator/filegator.git
cd filegator
cp configuration_sample.php configuration.php
chmod -R 775 private/
chmod -R 775 repository/
npm run dc:up
```

If you need a shell inside (for composer for example) always make sure you run under the `app` user. `npm run dc -- exec filegator su app`

Ftp and sftp images for testing are also available in `docker-compose-dev.yml` file.

## Compiles and hot-reloads

The following command will launch backend and frontend on ports 8081 and 8080:

```
npm run serve
```
Once everything is ready visit: `http://localhost:8080`

## Run tests & static analysis

Testing requires xdebug, php-zip and sqlite php extensions.

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse ./backend
npm run lint
npm run e2e
```

## Deployment

Set the website document root to `filegator/dist` directory. This is also known as 'public' folder.

NOTE: For security reasons `filegator/dist` is the ONLY folder you want to be exposed through the web. Everything else should be outside of your web root, this way people canâ€™t access any of your important files through the browser. If you run the script from the root folder, you will see the message **'Development mode'** as a security warning.
